Notes About ModuleReleaseNotes
==============================

This is a module for ProcessWire v3+ that shows some much needed information on each module's pre-update screen. A
"What's Changed" section is added that lists any Github Release Notes for the new version (along with all the commits
pushed between the currently installed version and the available version) or the contents of the project's CHANGELOG.md
file (if any) or simply a list of the last commits if the above are not available.
